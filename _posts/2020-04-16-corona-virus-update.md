The world seems to be going crazy.  I can't recall a time where things could be stranger.  It seems like 
all of the post-apocalyptic movies and stories we read are all coming true.  Although it's only been a short few weeks, the world outside my window is far different than I recall.

## Deaths in Virginia
As of this morning, our state is 18th in the nation in terms of overall infections at 6,182. The top infected county which shouldn't come as a surprise is Fairfax.  It's in northern Virgina so closer proximity to New York as well as it being a densely, populated urban area.
