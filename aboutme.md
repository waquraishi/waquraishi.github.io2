---
My name is Waseem and I live in Richmond, VA.  I'm a passionate software engineer, devoted husband and 
father to 3 wonderful kids.  I have the following qualities:

- I rock a killer beard
- Lost over 80 pounds doing intermittent fasting
- I'm extremely loyal to my family
- I love my job and messing around with computers

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
