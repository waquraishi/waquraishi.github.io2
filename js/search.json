If I bought a bag of peanuts and had an allergic reaction, no one would fault me if I threw it out. If I ended a relationship with a woman who hit me, no one would say that I had a commitment problem. But if I walk away from a seemingly secure route because my soul has other ideas, I am a flake?\n\nThe truth is that no one else can definitively know the path we are here to walk. It’s tempting to listen—many of us long for the omnipotent other—but unless they are genuine psychic intuitives, they can’t know. All others can know is their own truth, and if they’ve actually done the work to excavate it, they will have the good sense to know that they cannot genuinely know anyone else’s. Only soul knows the path it is here to walk. Since you are the only one living in your temple, only you can know its scriptures and interpretive structure.\n\nAt the heart of the struggle are two very different ideas of success—survival-driven and soul-driven. For survivalists, success is security, pragmatism, power over others. Success is the absence of material suffering, the nourishing of the soul be damned. It is an odd and ironic thing that most of the material power in our world often resides in the hands of younger souls. Still working in the egoic and material realms, they love the sensations of power and focus most of their energy on accumulation. Older souls tend not to be as materially driven. They have already played the worldly game in previous lives and they search for more subtle shades of meaning in this one—authentication rather than accumulation. They are often ignored by the culture at large, although they really are the truest warriors.\n\nA soulful notion of success rests on the actualization of our innate image. Success is simply the completion of a soul step, however unsightly it may be. We have finished what we started when the lesson is learned. What a fear-based culture calls a wonderful opportunity may be fruitless and misguided for the soul. Staying in a passionless relationship may satisfy our need for comfort, but it may stifle the soul. Becoming a famous lawyer is only worthwhile if the soul demands it. It is an essential failure if you are called to be a monastic this time around. If you need to explore and abandon ten careers in order to stretch your soul toward its innate image, then so be it. Flake it till you make it.\n",

I’ve read books, tried a bunch off different\ndiets and fads to see some benefits but gain it all back (and sometimes more).\n\nIt’s been a coaster of ups and downs and when I was just about to give up, \nI found intermittent fasting.\n\n\n\n1. Wedding2. Big Beard3. Friends4. Award5. Lunch\n\nIt’s not what you eat but when you eat!\nSo simple!  The only concept is to limit your calories by limiting the amount of time \nyou’re allowed to eat.  There’s a lot of varieties of intermittent fasting but the simplest I found was\n16/8.\n\nDuring 16/8, you eat for 8 hours and fast for 16 hours.  You can choose whatever time\nframe works bests for your life as long as you can keep to it.\n\nI choose to eat during the hours of 12 pm to 8 pm. All other times, I didn’t eat anything other than \nnon-calorie drinks, coffee, and lots of water.\n\nThat’s it! It’s that simple.  There’s nothing to buy and nothing else to do.  You can choose to \nexercise but it’s not required.  It’ll speed up your weight loss but at the end of the day, in order to lose\nweight, you have to eat less than you burn.\n\n\n  weight loss = calories_in &lt; calories_out\n\n\n\n\n    \n\nHere are some additional writings about different aspect of intermitting fasting including exercise,\ngood types of foods to consume and overall general health.\n\n\n            \n            &nbsp;intermittent-fasting&nbsp;(1)\n        \n        \n                    Test markdown\n                    \n                        February 28, 2015\n                    \n                \n                \n                    You can write regular markdown here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage.
