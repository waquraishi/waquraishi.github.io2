        "content": "From Wikipedia:\n\nAssociation football, more commonly known as football or soccer,[2] is a sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries, making it the world’s most popular sport.[3][4][5][6] The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal.\n\nThe goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms while it is in play and then only in their penalty area. Outfield players mostly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may use their head or torso to strike the ball instead. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time and/or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition. The Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association in 1863. Association football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA; French: Fédération Internationale de Football Association) which organises a World Cup every four years.[7]\n",

        "content": "Under what circumstances should we step off a path? When is it essential that we finish what we start? If I bought a bag of peanuts and had an allergic reaction, no one would fault me if I threw it out. If I ended a relationship with a woman who hit me, no one would say that I had a commitment problem. But if I walk away from a seemingly secure route because my soul has other ideas, I am a flake?\n\nThe truth is that no one else can definitively know the path we are here to walk. It’s tempting to listen—many of us long for the omnipotent other—but unless they are genuine psychic intuitives, they can’t know. All others can know is their own truth, and if they’ve actually done the work to excavate it, they will have the good sense to know that they cannot genuinely know anyone else’s. Only soul knows the path it is here to walk. Since you are the only one living in your temple, only you can know its scriptures and interpretive structure.\n\nAt the heart of the struggle are two very different ideas of success—survival-driven and soul-driven. For survivalists, success is security, pragmatism, power over others. Success is the absence of material suffering, the nourishing of the soul be damned. It is an odd and ironic thing that most of the material power in our world often resides in the hands of younger souls. Still working in the egoic and material realms, they love the sensations of power and focus most of their energy on accumulation. Older souls tend not to be as materially driven. They have already played the worldly game in previous lives and they search for more subtle shades of meaning in this one—authentication rather than accumulation. They are often ignored by the culture at large, although they really are the truest warriors.\n\nA soulful notion of success rests on the actualization of our innate image. Success is simply the completion of a soul step, however unsightly it may be. We have finished what we started when the lesson is learned. What a fear-based culture calls a wonderful opportunity may be fruitless and misguided for the soul. Staying in a passionless relationship may satisfy our need for comfort, but it may stifle the soul. Becoming a famous lawyer is only worthwhile if the soul demands it. It is an essential failure if you are called to be a monastic this time around. If you need to explore and abandon ten careers in order to stretch your soul toward its innate image, then so be it. Flake it till you make it.\n",

    "content": "\n&lt;p&gt;\n    I have struggled with weight as far back as I can remember.  I use to think I was just big boned, had bad \n    genetics, was short and just about everything else you can imagine. I've read books, tried a bunch off different\n    diets and fads to see some benefits but gain it all back (and sometimes more).  \n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n    It's been a coaster of ups and downs and when I was &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; about to give up, \n    I found &lt;b&gt;intermittent fasting&lt;/b&gt;.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;It's not &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; you eat but &lt;i&gt;when&lt;/i&gt; you eat!&lt;/h2&gt;\n    So simple!  The only concept is to limit your calories by limiting the amount of time \n    you're allowed to eat.  There's a lot of varieties of intermittent fasting but the simplest I found was the \n    16/8. \n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n    During the 16/8, you eat for &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt; hours and fast for &lt;b&gt;16&lt;/b&gt; hours.  You can choose whatever time\n    frame works bests for your life as long as you can keep to it.  \n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n    I choose to eat during the hours of 12 pm to 8 pm. All other times, I didn't eat anything other than \n    non-calorie drinks, coffee, and lots of water.  \n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n    That's it! It's that simple.  There's nothing to buy and nothing else to do.  You can &lt;i&gt;choose&lt;/i&gt; to \n    exercise but it's not required.  It'll speed up your weight loss but at the end of the day, in order to lose\n    weight, you have to eat less than you burn.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;weight loss = calories_in &lt; calories_out&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n \n    Here are some additional writings about different aspect of intermitting fasting including exercise,\n    good times of foods to consume and overall general health.\n\n\n\n        \n        &nbsp;books&nbsp;(1)\n    \n    \n                Flake it till you make it\n                \n                    February 26, 2015\n                \n            \n            \n                Under what circumstances should we step off a path?
